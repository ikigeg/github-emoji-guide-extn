# Code Review Emoji Guide - Browser extension

This is an attempt at capturing the wisdom of https://github.com/erikthedeveloper/code-review-emoji-guide and making it readily accessible during the review process.

## Usage

The easiest way to install this will be by the chrome store (link coming soon), otherwise:

1. Download [github-emoji-guide.zip](./github-emoji-guide.zip) to your machine
2. Unzip the file
3 Go to chrome://extensions/
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Point the dialog at the unzipped files (from step 2)
7. You should then start seeing the extension in the toolbar and review panels of pull requests
